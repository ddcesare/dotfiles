# dd's dotfiles

## What's this?
Just my way of starting fresh on a new (or recently wiped) mac. Better suited for a Ruby - JS developer, with some privacy/security concerns.

## First, acknowledges
Basically a big shout for the great work and dedication from all the devs listed on [Github does dotfiles project](https://dotfiles.github.io/), specially [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens). I've got pieces of codes and ideas from many of them :)

## Installation
0. Before you fresh start, backup everything: for your [supported mackup apps settings](https://github.com/lra/mackup#supported-applications), run `mackup backup` and the rest, your way. (I'm using [spideroak](https://spideroak.com/))
1. Format and Update macOS to the latest version with the App Store
2. Install Xcode from the App Store, open it and accept the license agreement
3. Install macOS Command Line Tools by running `xcode-select --install`
4. Clone the repo
```bash
cd; git clone https://github.com/didierofrivia/dotfiles.git
```
  * `cd dotfiles`
  * Run `instal.sh`
5. Get your mackup backup from you favourite storage service, and run `mackup restore`
