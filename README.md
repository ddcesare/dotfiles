# dd's dotfiles

## What's this?
Just my way of starting fresh on a new (or recently wiped) mac. Better suited for a Ruby - JS developer, with some privacy/security concerns.

## First, acknowledges
Basically a big shout for the great work and dedication from all the devs listed on [Github does dotfiles project](https://dotfiles.github.io/), specially [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens). I've got pieces of codes and ideas from many of them :)
